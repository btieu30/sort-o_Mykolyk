 * a1: The element at index p-1 is correct
 * q2: How many passes are necessary to completely sort?
 * a2: No more than length-1

SEL-QA:
 * q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
 * a0: array.length - 1
 * q1: What do you know after pass p?
 * a1: You know that all elements of index p-1 and less are correctly sorted.
 * q2: How do you know if sorted?
 * a2: We know that the array is sorted if every element has been swapped at least once.
 * q3: What does a pass boil down to?
 * a3: A pass boils down to moving the next smallest number into the next smallest index.
INS-QA: 
 * q0: How many passes to sort n elements?
 * a0: n-1 passes
 * q1: What do you know after pass p?
 * a1: We know that all elements of indices p-1 and less are correctly sorted.
 * q2: How will you know when sorted?
 * a2: The array is sorted once the partition reaches the end of the array.
 * q3: What constitues a pass?
 * a3: A pass is defined by the movement of a partition by one element to the
